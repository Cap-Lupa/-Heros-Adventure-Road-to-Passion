# Interactive Game Guide Website

Welcome to the Interactive Game Guide Website project! This is a personal project Iâ€™m building to learn more about web development and programming. The goal is to create an interactive game guide where users can explore game content like NPCs, items, weapons, quests, and more. This project will have features like search functionality, progress tracking, and save options.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:**  
  Search for NPCs, items, weapons, quests, etc. with dynamic, case-insensitive results.

- **Clickable Menus:**  
  Navigate through categories (e.g., Weapons, NPCs, Quests) and subcategories using buttons.

- **Progress Tracking:**  
  Track which items and quests you've found or completed, with options to save progress.

- **Highlight or Grey-out Choices:**  
  Based on your progress, certain options will be highlighted or greyed out to indicate their availability.

- **Save Progress:**  
  A simple save feature using LocalStorage (or a backend if implemented) to track your progress across sessions.
